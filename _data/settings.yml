# About Section
blurb: Welcome! My name is Vedant Singhania and I am from Palo Alto, California. I have been coding since I was 12 and since then, I have become highly proficient in HTML, Python, Java, and JavaScript, and various frameworks and libraries, I have taken college-level computer science courses in high school, and I am now in the midst of my first year as a computer science major at San José State University. While I enjoy working on my own projects to help people in their everyday lives, I also have a passion for contributing to open source code in the community.

    description: "For wheelchair users, it can be hard to see what's behind the chair, especially when backing up or turning, which can be dangerous because there is a high potential to hit an object or person. The aim of this project is to solve that problem by creating a low-cost device that can detect obstacles and warn the wheelchair user so they don't hit objects or people."
